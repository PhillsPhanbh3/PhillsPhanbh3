- 👨‍💻 I go by Phil, Phills, and @phillsphanbh3_the_bot_dev!

- 🎥 I live stream on twitch at https://twitch.tv/phillsphanbh3 I often code my bots while live on stream for the people that like to get a sneak peak! Whenever I am streaming I will have the purple streaming icon and streaming {stream name} in my status! (the {stream name} is well the name of the twitch stream ongoing)-
- 🎮 I like gaming so if you want to check out my twitch I stream rocket league, sometimes racing games, and sometimes coding! and join my server for some fun times! We get active from time to time but is a semi dead server with the hope of getting to 1k members and a discord bot that will be verified and one day become a mee6 competitor!
